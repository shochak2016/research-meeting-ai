# research-meeting-ai

This project serves as a tool to conduct live transcription of research meetings, and an AI based assistant which summarizes text, finds related papers, and allows you to take notes.

The code in this github is an overview of the back end software we used to get this up and running. 

To run using terminal, use bash command: streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
